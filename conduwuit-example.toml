# =============================================================================
#  This is the official example config for conduwuit.
#  If you use it for your server, you will need to adjust it to your own needs.
#  At the very least, change the server_name field!
# =============================================================================

[global]

# The server_name is the pretty name of this server. It is used as a suffix for user
# and room ids. Examples: matrix.org, conduit.rs

# The Conduit server needs all /_matrix/ requests to be reachable at
# https://your.server.name/ on port 443 (client-server) and 8448 (federation).

# If that's not possible for you, you can create /.well-known files to redirect
# requests (delegation). See
# https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixclient
# and
# https://spec.matrix.org/v1.9/server-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixserver
# for more information

# YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS
#server_name = "your.server.name"

# Servers listed here will be used to gather public keys of other servers.
# Generally, copying this exactly should be enough. (Currently, conduwuit doesn't
# support batched key requests, so this list should only contain Synapse
# servers.) Defaults to `matrix.org`
# trusted_servers = ["matrix.org"]



### Database configuration

# This is the only directory where conduwuit will save its data, including media
database_path = "/var/lib/conduwuit/"

# Database backend: Only rocksdb and sqlite are supported. Please note that sqlite
# will perform significantly worse than rocksdb as it is not intended to be used the
# way it is by conduwuit. sqlite only exists for historical reasons.
database_backend = "rocksdb"



### Network

# The port conduwuit will be running on. You need to set up a reverse proxy such as
# Caddy or Nginx so all requests to /_matrix on port 443 and 8448 will be
# forwarded to the conduwuit instance running on this port
# Docker users: Don't change this, you'll need to map an external port to this.
port = 6167

# default address (IPv4 or IPv6) conduwuit will listen on. Generally you want this to be
# localhost (127.0.0.1 / ::1). If you are using Docker or a container NAT networking setup, you
# likely need this to be 0.0.0.0. 
address = "127.0.0.1"

# How many requests conduwuit sends to other servers at the same time concurrently. Default is 500
# Note that because conduwuit is very fast unlike other homeserver implementations, setting this too
# high could inadvertently result in ratelimits kicking in, or overloading lower-end homeservers out there.
#
# A valid use-case for enabling this is if you have a significant amount of overall federation activity
# such as many rooms joined/tracked, and many servers in the true destination cache caused by that. Upon
# rebooting conduwuit, depending on how fast your resources are, client and incoming federation requests
# may timeout or be "stalled" for a period of time due to hitting the max concurrent requests limit from
# refreshing federation/destination caches and such.
#
# If you have a lot of active users on your homeserver, you will definitely need to raise this.
#
# No this will not speed up room joins.
#max_concurrent_requests = 500

# Max request size for file uploads
max_request_size = 20_000_000 # in bytes

# Uncomment unix_socket_path to listen on a UNIX socket at the specified path.
# If listening on a UNIX socket, you must remove/comment the 'address' key if defined and add your
# reverse proxy to the 'conduwuit' group, unless world RW permissions are specified with unix_socket_perms (666 minimum).
#unix_socket_path = "/run/conduwuit/conduwuit.sock"
#unix_socket_perms = 660

# Set this to true for conduwuit to compress HTTP response bodies using zstd.
# Please be aware that enabling HTTP compression may weaken or even defeat TLS.
# Most users should not need to enable this.
# See https://breachattack.com/ and https://wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH before deciding to enable this.
zstd_compression = false

# Vector list of IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges / subnets *in quotes* that you do not want conduwuit to send outbound requests to.
# Defaults to RFC1918, unroutable, loopback, multicast, and testnet addresses for security.
#
# To disable, set this to be an empty vector (`[]`).
#
# Currently this does not account for proxies in use like Synapse does.

# endpoint, it is simply an announcement check endpoint. I don't plan on using
# this so feel free to disable it.
allow_check_for_updates = true

# If you are using delegation via well-known files and you cannot serve them from your reverse proxy, you can

# Option to control adding arbitrary text to the end of the user's displayname upon registration with a space before the text.

# Set this to true to use RocksDB config options that are tailored to HDDs (slower device storage)

### Presence

#allow_incoming_presence = false

# Config option to control outgoing presence updates/requests. Defaults to false.
# This option sends presence updates to other servers, but does not receive any unless `allow_incoming_presence` is true.
# Note that presence on conduwuit is very fast unlike Synapse's.
# If using outgoing presence, you MUST enable `allow_local_presence` as well.
#
# Warning: Outgoing federated presence is not spec compliant due to relying on PDUs and EDUs combined.
# Outgoing presence will not be very reliable due to this and any issues with federated outgoing presence are very likely attributed to this issue.
# Incoming presence and local presence are unaffected.

# Other options not in [global]:
