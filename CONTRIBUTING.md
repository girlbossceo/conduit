# Contributing guide

This page is for about contributing to conduwuit. The [development](development.md) page may be of interest for you as well.

If you would like to work on an [issue][issues] that is not assigned, preferably ask in the Matrix room first at [#conduwuit:puppygock.gay][conduwuit-matrix], and comment on it.

### Linting and Formatting

It is mandatory all your changes satisfy the lints (clippy, rustc, rustdoc, etc) and your code is formatted via the **nightly** `cargo fmt`. A lot of the `rustfmt.toml` features depend on nightly toolchain. It would be ideal if they weren't nightly-exclusive features, but they currently still are. CI's rustfmt uses nightly.

If you need to allow a lint, please make sure it's either obvious as to why (e.g. clippy saying redundant clone but it's actually required) or it has a comment saying why. Do not write inefficient code for the sake of satisfying lints. If a lint is wrong and provides a more inefficient solution or suggestion, allow the lint and mention that in a comment.

### Running CI tests locally

conduwuit's CI for tests, linting, formatting, audit, etc use [`engage`][engage]. engage can be installed from nixpkgs or `cargo install engage`. conduwuit's Nix flake devshell has the nixpkgs engage with `direnv`. Use `engage --help` for more usage details.

To test, format, lint, etc that CI would do, install engage, allow the `.envrc` file using `direnv allow`, and run `engage`.

All of the tasks are defined at the [engage.toml][engage.toml] file. You can view all of them neatly by running `engage list`

If you would like to run only a specific engage task group, use `just`:
- `engage just <group>`
- Example: `engage just lints`

If you would like to run a specific engage task in a specific group, use `just <GROUP> [TASK]`: `engage just lints cargo-fmt`

The following binaries are used in [`engage.toml`][engage.toml]:

- [`engage`][engage]
- `nix`
- [`direnv`][direnv]
- `rustc`
- `cargo`
- `cargo-fmt`
- `rustdoc`
- `cargo-clippy`
- [`cargo-audit`][cargo-audit]
- [`cargo-deb`][cargo-deb]
- [`lychee`][lychee]

### Matrix tests

CI runs [Complement][complement], but currently does not fail if results from the checked-in results differ with the new results. If your changes are done to fix Matrix tests, note that in your pull request. If more Complement tests start failing from your changes, please review the logs (they are uploaded as artifacts) and determine if they're intended or not.

If you'd like to run Complement locally using Nix, see the [testing](docs/development/testing.md) page.

[Sytest][sytest] support will come soon.

### Writing documentation

conduwuit's website uses [`mdbook`][mdbook] and deployed via CI using GitHub Pages in the [`documentation.yml`][documentation.yml] workflow file with Nix's mdbook in the devshell. All documentation is in the `docs/` directory at the top level. The compiled mdbook website is also uploaded as an artifact.

To build the documentation using Nix, run: `bin/nix-build-and-cache just .#book`

The output of the mdbook generation is in `result/`. mdbooks can be opened in your browser from the individual HTML files without any web server needed.

### Inclusivity and Diversity

All **MUST** code and write with inclusivity and diversity in mind. See the [following page by Google on writing inclusive code and documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).

This **EXPLICITLY** forbids usage of terms like "blacklist"/"whitelist" and "master"/"slave", [forbids gender-specific words and phrases](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#gender-neutral-pronouns), forbids ableist language like "sanity-check", "cripple", or "insane", and forbids culture-specific language (e.g. US-only holidays or cultures).

No exceptions are allowed. Dependencies that may use these terms are allowed but [do not replicate the name in your functions or variables](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation#write-around).

In addition to language, write and code with the user experience in mind. This is software that intends to be used by everyone, so make it easy and comfortable for everyone to use. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

### Variable, comment, function, etc standards

Rust's default style and standards with regards to [function names, variable names, comments](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html), etc applies here.

### Creating pull requests

Please try to keep contributions to the GitHub. While the mirrors of conduwuit allow for pull/merge requests, there is no guarantee I will see them in a timely manner. Additionally, please mark WIP or unfinished or incomplete PRs as drafts. This prevents me from having to ping once in a while to double check the status of it, especially when the CI completed successfully and everything so it *looks* done.

If you open a pull request on one of the mirrors, it is your responsibility to inform me about its existence. In the future I may try to solve this with more repo bots in the conduwuit Matrix room. There is no mailing list or email-patch support on the sr.ht mirror, but if you'd like to email me a git patch you can do so at `strawberry@puppygock.gay`.

Direct all PRs/MRs to the `main` branch.

By sending a pull request or patch, you are agreeing that your changes are allowed to be licenced under the Apache-2.0 licence and all of your conduct is in line with the Contributor's Covenant.
