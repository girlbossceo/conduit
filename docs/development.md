# Development

Information about developing the project. If you are only interested in using
it, you can safely ignore this section. If you plan on contributing, see the
[contributor's guide](contributing.md).

## List of forked dependencies
During conduwuit development, we have had to fork some dependencies to support our use-cases in some areas. This ranges from things said upstream project won't accept for any reason, faster-paced development (unresponsive or slow upstream), conduwuit-specific usecases, or lack of time to upstream some things.

- [ruma/ruma][1]: <https://github.com/girlbossceo/ruwuma> - various performance improvements, more features, faster-paced development, client/server interop hacks upstream won't accept, etc
- [facebook/rocksdb][2]: <https://github.com/girlbossceo/rocksdb> - liburing build fixes, GCC build fix, and logging callback C API for Rust tracing integration
- [tikv/jemallocator][3]: <https://github.com/girlbossceo/jemallocator> - musl builds seem to be broken on upstream
- [zyansheep/rustyline-async][4]: <https://github.com/girlbossceo/rustyline-async> - tab completion callback and `CTRL+\` signal quit event for CLI
- [rust-rocksdb/rust-rocksdb][5]: <https://github.com/girlbossceo/rust-rocksdb-zaidoon1> - [`@zaidoon1`'s][8] fork has quicker updates, more up to date dependencies. Our changes fix musl build issues, Rust part of the logging callback C API, removes unnecessary `gtest` include, and uses our RocksDB and jemallocator
- [tokio-rs/tracing][6]: <https://github.com/girlbossceo/tracing> - Implements `Clone` for `EnvFilter` to support dynamically changing tracing envfilter's alongside other logging/metrics things

## Debugging with `tokio-console`

[`tokio-console`][7] can be a useful tool for debugging and profiling. To make
a `tokio-console`-enabled build of conduwuit, enable the `tokio_console` feature,
disable the default `release_max_log_level` feature, and set the
`--cfg tokio_unstable` flag to enable experimental tokio APIs. A build might
look like this:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build \
    --release \
    --no-default-features \
    --features=systemd,element_hacks,gzip_compression,brotli_compression,zstd_compression,tokio_console
```
