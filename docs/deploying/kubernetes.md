# conduwuit for Kubernetes

conduwuit doesn't support horizontal scalability or distributed loading
natively, however a community maintained Helm Chart is available here to run
conduwuit on Kubernetes: <https://gitlab.cronce.io/charts/conduwuit>

Should changes need to be made, please reach out to the maintainer in our
Matrix room as this is not maintained/controlled by the conduwuit maintainers.
