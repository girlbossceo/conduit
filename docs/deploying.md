# Deployment options

There are several ways to deploy a Conduit server.

- [Simple (Recommended)](deploying/simple.md) - This is the recommended way to set up Conduit.
- [Debian](deploying/debian.md) - If you're using a debian-based system, you may find the `deb` package useful.
- [Docker](deploying/docker.md) - We provide multi-arch OCI images for Conduit.
- [Nix](deploying/nix.md) - Nix flake based setup.
