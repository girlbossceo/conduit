#### What is Matrix?

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is an open network for secure and decentralized
communication. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges (also called Matrix Appservices)
to communicate with users outside of Matrix, like a community on Discord.

#### What is the goal?

An efficient Matrix homeserver that's easy to set up and just works. You can install
it on a mini-computer like the Raspberry Pi to host Matrix for your family,
friends or company.

#### Can I try it out?

An official conduwuit server ran by me is available at transfem.dev ([element.transfem.dev](https://element.transfem.dev) / [cinny.transfem.dev](https://cinny.transfem.dev))

transfem.dev is a public homeserver that can be used, it is not a "test only homeserver". This means there are rules, so please read the rules: [https://transfem.dev/homeserver_rules.txt](https://transfem.dev/homeserver_rules.txt)

transfem.dev is also listed at [servers.joinmatrix.org](https://servers.joinmatrix.org/)

#### What is the current status?

conduwuit is a hard fork of Conduit which is in beta, meaning you can join and participate in most
Matrix rooms, but not all features are supported and you might run into bugs
from time to time.
