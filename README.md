#### What is Matrix?

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is an open network for secure and decentralized
communication. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges (also called Matrix Appservices)
to communicate with users outside of Matrix, like a community on Discord.

#### What is the goal?

An efficient Matrix homeserver that's easy to set up and just works. You can install
it on a mini-computer like the Raspberry Pi to host Matrix for your family,
friends or company.

#### Can I try it out?

An official conduwuit server ran by me is available at transfem.dev ([element.transfem.dev](https://element.transfem.dev) / [cinny.transfem.dev](https://cinny.transfem.dev))

#### What is the current status?

conduwuit is a fork of Conduit which is in beta, meaning you can join and participate in most
Matrix rooms, but not all features are supported and you might run into bugs
from time to time.

There are still a few nice to have features missing that some users may notice:

- Outgoing read receipts and typing indicators (receiving works)

#### What's different about your fork than upstream Conduit?

See [docs/differences.md](docs/differences.md)

#### Why does this fork exist? Why don't you contribute back upstream?

I now intend on contributing back as time and mental energy sees fit, but my fork still exists as a way to:
- avoid unnecessary Matrix and general developer politics
- avoid bikeshedding unnecessary or irrelevant things in upstream MRs
- Fast tracked bug fixes, performance improvements, security improvements, and new features
- Have early access to MRs that may not be suitable/acceptable for Conduit (e.g. too niche, too advanced for general users, only being blocked due to pending on contributor actions that we can fix ourselves downstream, pending Matrix spec stuff, etc)
- Support unspecced or WIP features
- Have official support for other OS's like Windows, macOS, and BSD.
- Have a **stable** testing ground for some MRs or new features and bug fixes

And various other reasons that may not be listed here.

#### How can I contribute?

1. Look for an issue you would like to work on and make sure it's not assigned
   to other users
2. Ask someone to assign the issue to you (comment on the issue or chat in
   [#conduwuit:puppygock.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#conduwuit:puppygock.gay))
3. Fork the repo and work on the issue.
4. Submit a PR (please keep contributions to the GitHub repo, main development is done here, not the GitLab repo which exists just as a mirror. If you are avoiding GitHub, feel free to join our Matrix chat to get your patch in.)
